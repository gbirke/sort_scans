# sort_scans

This is an interactive python command line utility that iterates over all
PDFs in a directory, offering to add additional information to the name
and moving it into destination directories.

For a visual preview, this tool creates a copy of the file that's
currently up for rename in `/tmp/sort_scan_preview.pdf`. You can use PDF
viewers like Zathura or macOS Preview to show a visual preview of the file
you're currently working on.
